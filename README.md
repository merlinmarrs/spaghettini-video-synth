This simple kit was developed with funding from La Diagonale UP Saclay and the CVEC programme :

"Arduino Coding and Video Synthesis Workshop

Lean to code in C with Arduino, solder and assemble a custom printed-circuit board made in the Fablab, and make your own algorithmically-generated video art!

This workshop is inspired by the improvisational music of Live coding (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) and the burgeoning minimalist Bytebeats movement (https://nightmachines.tv/bytebeats-tutorial).

Our video synthesis kit plugs in to the Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/), a reprogrammable embedded micro-controller that can interact with the world through code, and uses the VGAX library (https://github.com/smaffer/vgax) to generate funky video.

Meet other creative technologists and sharpen your expertise in computer sciences and electronics soldering!"
